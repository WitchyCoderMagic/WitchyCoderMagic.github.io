									<h2>My Career Aspirations</h2>
									<p>I am very passionate about computer programming, it is something that I have always had an interest in ever since I was younger. After dipping my toe into many types of computer programming such as artificial intelligence programming, game development and GUI based development. I believe my skills best lie within games development, I love the feeling when I solve an error that has been plaguing my game code for hours, such as when I was working on my JavaScript canvas game and couldn't figure out why my player's bullets wouldn't fire out in the correct direction and I used trigonometry to solve it. </p>
									<p>In the future I would love to be part of a hard-working games development team like Square Enix or Ubisoft Studios. To work towards this I plan of working hard in my spare time to develop a deep, full understanding of programming techniques including object oriented programming and dynamic programming as well as familiarising myself with relevant coding languages used in the industry. I'd also like to find myself a part-time job to gain invaluable experience in the industry.</p>
