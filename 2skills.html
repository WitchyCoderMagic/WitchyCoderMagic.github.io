									<p>This page should focus on analysis of own skills in relation to those required&nbsp;</p>
									<p>It should also provide evidence of current skill level (taken from this module or other modules)</p>

									<h2>My Skills As a Computer Professional</h2>
									<p>As a computer professional I have a variety of skills, for example I take pride in my work, it is my opinion that if you do a job it should be a job well done. I am personable and have a history of getting along with co-workers and colleagues. I'm a natural time keeper and enjoy using my whiteboard at home to plan my tasks for the day / week, this includes when I should take time out to improve my computer-based skills. I am always striving for improvement in things I enjoy like networking and meeting new people and programming.</p>

									<p>Of my hard skills I am intermediate at c++ coding, this can be shown through my console-based application created for my year 1 coding project + proposal which took a few days.</p>
									<img src="/images/console application c++.png" alt="a console-based application that allows the user to create and delete tasks of different importance levels">
									<p>I'm at an intermediate level in c#, this can be seen through the angry birds project I made through unity with gravity, de-spawning, online asset usage and destructible terrain (5 hours).</p>
									<img src="/images/angy birds unity.png" alt="an angry birds clone create with the unity game engine which has destructible enemies and terrain as well as a fun slingshot that the bird is fired out of">
									<p>I am a beginner at Lua and created a basic odd or even game through roblox studio which displays the dice on the screen after in 3d, plays a sound and randomly spawns particle effects around the dice (5 hours).</p>

									<p>I am intermediate at javascript, I created a webcanvas game like asteroids where the enemies can spawn in all different sizes and directions and get smaller when shot, despawning player shots once off of the screen.</p>
									<img src="images/webcanvas game javascript.png" alt="an asteroids clone created in javascript using a html webcanvas">
									<p>I am a beginner at python creating a basic tic-tac-toe game using the pygame graphics library, which draws green circles and red crosses to the board and utilises a state machine to display a winning or draw screen once the game terminates.</p>
									<img src="images/tictactoe pygame.png" alt="a local multiplayer tic-tac-toe game that displays red crosses and green circles when player one and two play">
									<p>Lastly I am a beginner at gdotscript (godot's native language), this can be shown through the space invaders clone I created where each enemy is destructible and move downward towards the player ship where they will then destroy it. The player can shoot bullets that despawn once offscreen and win once all of the enemies are destroyed</p>

									<p>Overall my knowledge of classes, functions, game functions and usage of game creating engines should give me a fighting chance within the games industry.</p>

									<p>Of my skills to improve I believe I need to improve my ai skills to create enaging enemies that the player will enjoy interacting with / battling. I should work on creating games using 3d assets such as vr games. I should learn unreal engine so I can develop graphicly pleasing multiplatform games. And I should learn java because it is a powerful coding language with a multititude of uses in all things</p>
